# BubbleSortSimple
a simple bubble sort in python.

comparing two values in a list of numbers,
it swaps the values if left value is larger than right value.
when swaps, it sets a boolean flag to True to keep going.

it repeats iterating through the list.
stops when flag is false, and no swaps have been made iterating throught the list.

I have a function to create a list of 100 random numbers to be sorted.
